- I am a Ph.D. student in the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo since 2018, and am also a partime researcher at [RSVP.ai](https://rsvp.ai/en/#/index), a start up focusing on NLP. I am co-supervised by [Prof. Ming Li](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~mli/) and [Prof. Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/). 

- I am working on Natural Language Processing problems, especially on Question Answering, Information Retrieval and Machine Learning procedures. 

- Before my Ph.D. program, I was a undergraduate student majored in Mathematics at Fudan University in Shanghai, China.
